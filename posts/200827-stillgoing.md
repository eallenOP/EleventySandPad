Well, I've been using this IDE for a day and apart from some odd behaviour on my dashboard (not showing any of my sandboxes at all, for example) I quite like it. 

I can code a bit on the iPad and apart from everything being a bit small it looks quite good and works quite well.

On the other hand, Repl.it replied to my bug report pretty quickly and that IDE also looks fine on iPad. I think overall I found it easier to get an Eleventy project started on that platform, but this platform had better templates (like this one) when I worked out how to find them.

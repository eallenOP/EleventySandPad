# Hello?

It's been pretty difficult to find a browser-based IDE that actually works. They're all full of bugs!

## Questions

Questions I am waiting to find out the answers to:

- Is CodeSandbox.io better than Repl.it and Glitch.com?
- Is there an online IDE out there that actually works?
- Can I therefore code on my iPad?
- Can I use my chosen technology, in this case eleventy?
